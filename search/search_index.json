Thanks Ryan &amp; Miriam! </p> <p></p> <p>This class may be a bit different from most of your classes so far at Carleton. I hope you will see these differences as exciting and intellectually stimulating, but you should be aware of the following caveats as we begin. If you can face these challenges with persistence, verve, and (reasonably) good humour\u2014and abide by the code of conduct outlined below\u2014we should have an intellectually enlivening semester. If you have any concerns about these caveats, please come talk to me. I am confident we can find a way forward if we work together.</p> <p>The course is an experiment</p> <p>I'm approaching the history of the internet from an archaeological angle. While there are people working in this area, the field is wide open for innovation, critical engagment, reflection, and experimentation. That's what makes it exciting. I sign up to teach courses where there's something I want to learn. That's why things might not play out exactly the way it says on the syllabus or this website. You'll need to keep an eye on the updates.</p> <p>An experiential course such as this opens itself up to many quirks: the syllabus may shift; a given tool might not work as expected; an experiment might veer off track or fail altogether. In other words, this course will require both an inventive spirit and patience from its students.</p> <p>I'm not interested in essays</p> <p>The work in this class asks you to be conscious about relationships among historical materials, digital media and messages. It will require substantial writing, but it will not look like a 20 page  paper at semester\u2019s end. Instead, your engagement will require sustained work and will be multimodal, comprising text and other elements (e.g. digital images, maps, graphics, sprites, etc). </p> <p>There will be collaboration (which is not 'group work')</p> <p>Digital humanities projects often require collaboration among scholars who bring different intellectual and technical skills to expansive projects. This class will require you to work together in class and to support each other. Indeed, I am not bothered at all should you find help and support outside this class with regard to the technical aspects of the course - learning how to distribute responsibilities, and acknowledging and sharing credit is part of the point here. I do ask you to acknowledge in your written work when you've had collaborative help.</p> <p>You will be required to acquire some technical skills (old and new)</p> <p>I do not require or assume any particular technical experience as we begin this course, but I will expect you to be willing to experiment with new tools and learn new technical skills throughout the semester. \u201cI\u2019m not very technical\u201d will not excuse you from the hands-on portions of the course any more than \u201cI\u2019m not poetic\u201d would excuse you from reading Dickinson in a survey of American literature. Some of the tools we play with you may find useful for your research interests; some you will not. But I expect you to try them with enthusiasm and an open mind.

WARNING: Do not adjust the mkdocs.yml file unless you know what you're doing. </p> <p>As we move forward, you'll receive feedback on your memex, and so demonstrating that you've taken that feedback on board will also become one of the considerations that we use in evaluating your work.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The highlighted file and subfolders get dragged-and-dropped into your <code>docs</code> folder on your github repository, remember.</p>"},{"location":"2.Assessment/Personal%20Memex/","title":"Personal Memex","text":"<p>In this assignment, which unrolls over the duration of the entire term, you will create your own personal 'memex' of a kind first described by Vannevar Bush in his article, 'As We May Think.' published in The Atlantic in 1945.</p> <p>You will need to download and install obsidian.md to do this.

This helps change my thinking, and makes me realize that perhaps I need to cycle back to some of the other papers, or perhaps dive deeper... reading is cyclical, as an academic. So I'll have a note with the basic information about an article, all of its bibliographic data so I can cite things properly. I might even have a small summary of the paper in that note (see questions below). Then I'll have lots of atomic notes, individual thoughts or observations. These atomic will be tagged with key questions I think they might help answer. These atomic notes will also all contain a link to the original bibliographic note, so I know where I'm drawing from.

This approach can be a good way to make your original source notes.</p> <p>The Rhetorical Pr\u00e9cis is a formula designed to help you move beyond simple summary to a more analytical synopsis of a work. As such, the pr\u00e9cis, in a compact form, forces you to think about both the content and method of a piece of scholarship. This is very useful in developing an historiographical understanding of the work you are reading, of the connections between works. The formula for the pr\u00e9cis is based on a few simple sentences:</p> <ol> <li>Sentence one gives the following information:<ul> <li>name of the author, title of the work, date in parenthesis;</li> <li>an intentionally chosen active verb (argues, asserts, claims, denies, refutes, proves, disproves, explains, etc.);</li> <li>a that clause containing the major claim (thesis) of the work.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Sentence two gives an explanation of how the author develops and supports the major claim of the work identified in the first sentence.</li> <li>Sentence three states the author\u2019s apparent purpose, followed by an \u201cin order to\u201d phrase.</li> </ol> <p>Formula:</p> <p>In Chapter 1 of One Dimensional Man (1964), Herbert Marcuse argues that [...]. To build this argument, Marcuse [...]. Marcuse makes this argument in order to [...].</p> <p>Here's an example from Daniel Nemser's Infrastructures of Race: Concentration and Biopolitics in Colonial Mexico (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2017):</p> <p>In Infrastructures of Race (2017), Daniel Nemser argues that colonial Spanish America created modern racialization by spatializing race as an infrastructure of domination and accumulation. To build this argument, Nemser draws on Foucault's biopolitical regime and Lefebvre's production of space and territorializing of domination, and divides his analysis into four chapters that move through the colonial period through a succession of material, spatial practices: congregaci\u00f3n (concentration), recogimiento (enclosure), seperaci\u00f3n (segregated districts), and colecci\u00f3n. Nemser does this in order to reorient the social construction of race away from bodily difference and to material space and domination, as a means of overcoming the naturalization of difference as a thing upon which race is projected.</p> <p>That's full of jargon, but it makes sense to me based on a lot of previous readings. When you write your own pr\u00e9cis/source note, they will likewise build off of your previous knowledge.</p> <p>My view is that any given note made in Obsidian shouldn't require you to scroll to read it. When that starts to happen, it's time to break things into atomic notes that link to the source, and wherever else as appropriate. Chad Black suggests that your next move should be to identify what you found significant in the piece you read. For instance, identify a question or theme raised in class that the reading helps to answer or addresses. Then explain why you think this reading matters? How does it connect to the other readings of the week or previous weeks. How does it connect with work you're reading outside of class assignments, etc? The answers to all of these questions can become atomic notes.</p>"},{"location":"3.Technical_Help/6.Text%20Formatting/","title":"6.Text Formatting","text":"<p>You can have lists like this</p> <pre><code>- first\n- second\n- third\n</code></pre> <p>Or checklist lists to</p> <pre><code>- [ ] ==Get==\n- [ ] things\n- [ ] ~~done~~\n</code></pre> <p>You can make headers using the <code>#</code> like this:</p> <pre><code># Really Big Header\n## Level Two Sub Header\n### Level Three Sub Header\n</code></pre> <p>If you forget the space between the <code>#</code> and the text, congratulations, you've made a </p> <pre><code>#tag\n#tag/subtag\n</code></pre> <p>In the right-hand sidepane in Obsidian, you can also view a tag explorer to help you navigate your materials.</p> <p>You can make a link to another note in your vault by typing <code>[[</code> and then scroll through the popup of note titles, or start typing the name of a new note you want to make at that spot; eg <code>[[this note doesn't exist yet]]</code> but if I clicked on that link in Obsidian I'd get a new note with that title.</p> <p>You can make a link to a website like this: <code>[link text](https://some.website.com)</code> changing up 'link text' and the url, obviously. nb there is no space between the square bracket bit and the parentheses.</p> <p>Within obsidian, you can drag and drop images right in.

And as far as network analysis goes, it's the topology - the pattern of what is connected to what - that matters. Select a more recent network map. Load it into Gephi. Run some statistics like 'betweeness centrality' (ie, a node that lies along the most shortest paths between every pair of nodes in the network) or 'modularity', nodes that share a similar pattern of localized interconnectivity.

My goal is to teach you how to learn, while also exploring the history of the internet and its broader historical antecedents. This was the point of Monday's class - slides at: https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/slides/jan9  </li> <li>to equip you with a framework to help you read like an academic and begin to extract useful information from the readings.  I framed 'theory' as a way of looking at the world that prompts us to ask some kinds of questions rather than other kinds of questions; a theoretical framework helps us identify what counts as 'important' when we listen to a lecture or read a journal article.

Over in the class discord, there has been some great discussion and mutual support getting through a couple of the rough edges. Things we've discovered so far:</p> <ul> <li>everyone should update all of the plugins in Obsidian before they try to configure the Hypothesis and Zotero note annotation setup. So - click the cogwheel icon at bottom left of the Obsidian interface, and go into the 'community plugins' settings. Hit the 'check for plugin updates' button; once it runs, if there are any plugins to update, it'll change to say 'update all'. Hit that. That should solve most issues you'll run into.</li> <li>Some windows users might find that nothing happens when you try to run the Hypothes.is extraction (ctrl+shift+h). In Discord, I have pinned some messages and screenshots in the 'tech help please' channel that shows you how to fix this.</li> <li>When you run the Zotero annotation extractor, it might seem like nothing has happened, or you get some kind of strange error message. Check the <code>1-inbox</code> folder in your vault - if the extractor has worked, you'll see a note in there. Check that note; if it has content, then everything is good and you can ignore the error message.
