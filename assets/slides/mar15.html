<li>they were CS dropouts, joined the commune, decided they&#39;d get it &#39;online&#39;</li>
<li>they introduced a computer into a culture that already was run on informal networks coordinated through physical billboards in coffee shops, music venues, on the streets.</li>
<li>there were even phone lines with human operators (operating out of their own home), telephone trees, to try to help people locate their kids in the scene; also coordinated protests and rapid responses; there were &#39;switchboards&#39; for all sorts of purposes all around the bay</li>
<li>they wanted to use the computer to coordinate and consolidate these switchboards, for more effective action</li>
<li>the 940 they got was the actual one from Stanford, which had been on lease; they convinced the actual owner it was worth more as a tax-write off to them.</li>
<li>the commune wired it up, programmed it from scratch, created the &#39;Resource One Generalized Information Retrieval System&#39;, ROGIRS, written by Ephrem Lipkin - a way to manage this underground alternative society</li>
<li>they obtain terminals&amp;modems and place them in the coffeeshops etc but camouflaged in boxes, with &#39;community memory&#39; painted on the side, make them less jarring</li>

<li>people start leaving all sorts of things, even having conversations</li>
<li>the switchboard part kinda failed, but the community part thrived; to fill in the gap left by the switchboard, they create a.social service referral dtabase that actual social workers used; the resource one people would call around and would update the information themselves in the machine, keep track of everything &amp; then they <em>printed the thing out and mailed it to social workers</em> .  three ring binder, but still a networked object.</li>

# ALRIGHT

... I hear you say. 

### The ARPANET is not the INTERNET. Can we get to the Internetting part?

I'm glad you used that word 'internetting'. 

Internet isn't a noun, it's a verb. So let's talk about Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn
</div>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>both working at UCLA. Tasked with figuring out how to make the different networks funded by ARPA (not just ARPANet) talk to one another</li>
<li>eg, in particular, packet radio, satellite radio</li>
<li>had to be compensate for errors, and now had to make the networks talk</li>
<li>Cerf &amp; Kahn get the credit, but many many people worked on this dimension to the larger project</li>
</ul>

Well, in a moment. Remember Alohanet? 

<img src="xerox.jpg" alt="" style="width: 600px; object-fit: fill">


Xerox Palo Alto Research Center adapts Alohanet method for wired communcation around its facilities.
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>When you broadcast packets, they can collide. Different terminals might broadcast at the same time. Alohanet builds in an element of randomization to when you might transmit, and also builds in the concept of acknowledgement that data was received.</p>
<p>doing this over cable increases the bandwith considerably, and the speed. Almost as if it&#39;s just there, in the aether... branded as ethernet. emerges out of 1973 phd thesis by a guy name Robert Metcalfe, who came to work at PARC after graduation. Commercial spinoff in 1981, 3com, which powers all sorts of commerical local area networks in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>Ethernet is part of the solution to &#39;internetting&#39;.</p>
<p>Finding this solution  is the work of the Network Working Group, now branded as &#39;International&#39;</p>
<ul>
<li>INWG brings together people from ARPANET, British NPL, CYCLADES, and others, including military (who had their own nodes on the ARPANET</li>
</ul>
<p>&#39;Ethernet ideas might serve well in garrison or aboard a ship. Packet radio concepts are crucial for local area mobile communication, ARPANET technology is appropriate for fixed installations as in US or Europe. Finally, packet satellite supports wide geographic coverage... the conculsion is that many different transmission technologies are needed for military operations...&#39; Cerf, 1979</p>
<p>maybe this is the origin of the idea that the &#39;internet was designed for secure comms in case of nukes&#39; comes from.</p>

Cerf and Kahn oversee a series of meetings and seminar to hammer out details amongst interested parties

- datagrams from cyclades
- error correction and random access from ethernet/alohanet, 
- and also: no more imps or network control protocol. The host itself has to handle this.

- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->Transmission Cotnrol Protocol (TCP) hammered out by 1973
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>TCP was for hosts to implement.
    - reflects design philosophy of Cyclades and Ethernet
    - original design of ARPAnet had extremely reliable network connections, but that was not something that could be counted on for <em>inter</em> networking. Also, IMPs delivered things in sequence. If they were out of sequence, chaose. New protocol handles this.
    - this solution was not inevitable; others were proposed. But other protocols might replicate national or institutional borders, and might not scale. This way, host-to-host makes everything appear seemless, one giant space.</p>

1978: TCP gets split into TCP/IP

<li>for various technical reasons, this single protocol TCP eventually gets split so that host-to-host protocol becomes TCP and the the business of passing packets around whereever in the system or systems is handled by an internetwork protocol, IP.

BBN starts packaging TCP/IP into Unix operating system; it gets incorporated into other flavours of computing machinery too. Including in IBM machines.

But... most hosts on ARPANET continued to putter along with the original specifications: they were quite happy just talking amongst themselves.

Decision from on high: You **will** shift to TCP/IP by January 1983 or be cut out of ARPANET entirely. 

The clock is ticking....

<aside class="notes"><p>also, DCA is worried by the growth of consumer grade computers and the possibility that TCP/IP makes it easy to &#39;hack&#39; into the network.

## Summary

- before you can internet, you need to network
- users have to find a reason to use
- your users aren't who you might think they are
- what they'll use it for isn't what you think it'll be
- simpler wins out over complex
- military & politics are always in the background
- The internet is 'invented' 1973-1983.
- Internet Culture is happening at the same time, and not even mostly on ARPANET
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>Abbate: &quot;In the period 1973-1983 ARPA created a new generation of technologies for packet radio, packet satellite, and internetworking. The ARPANET went through a number of transformations: the entire network community swtiched to TCP.IP [in the us at least], the military users were split off to their own network, and the ARPANET became part of a larger system - the Internet - that encompassed a number of military and experimental networks... the dominant model for internetworking would the system worked out by Vinton Cerg and Robert Kahn.&quot;</p>

quick history of video games

hacker culture, phreak culture

emergence of BBSs and online culture that *isn't* internet

including MUDs too I think
