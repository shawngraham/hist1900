<aside class="notes"><p>We&#39;ll follow the work of Brian Winston here. This isn&#39;t to say this is the best framework, or the only framework; it just happens to <em>be</em> a framework that helps direct our attention to certain common patterns. This moves us into the world of historical theory; different theories cause us to pay attention to different elements and the way they interrelate. History isn&#39;t the past; history is a tool for <em>making sense</em> of the past in the <strong>present</strong>. One thing you might make a note of is to look Brian Winston up, look up reviews of his work. This is the work of <em>historiography</em> and is just as necessary to doing history as all the other bits.</p>

## 'Oh, what if we have two trains on the line at once?'

- within a decade, hundreds of miles built
- problem of communicating when the line is clear now pressing
	- 1838 Edward Davy
	- 1838 William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>Davy was a phsyician and pharmacist. In 1836 publishes ideas around telegraphy and demonstrates a working model in 1837. Also invents a kind of relay where a needle dips into mercurcy when electricity passes through the coil. Approaches the railroad with his solution.</p>
<p>Cooke and Wheatstone are working at the same time; they too approached a railroad (in their case, the great western railway), paddington to west drayton</p>
<p>Both teams get patents at roughly the same time, sets off huge legal battles which eventually ruin Davy, who gives up, moves to australia. C &amp; W eventually have court battles with Morse, too.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT- railroad, not admiralty. And the idea of carrying all sorts of goods quickly makes it clear that a telegraph could carry all sorts of messages, not just safety rail-related things.</p>

William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone's electric telegraph ("needle telegraph") from 1837 now in the London Science Museum
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>system had 5 galvometers, required multiple wires/circuits; by deflecting the needles you could indicate where on the diamond to read the letter. Davy&#39;s system seems to have used chemically treated paper to record electrical impulses (an ancestor of the fax machine!).  Meanwhile, in Germany, russian diplomat named Pawel Schilling builds his own telegraph device based like the others on the galvanometer, but uses single wire and just treats the deflections as a kind of code, where left/right deflections (positive, negative) could give you RL=A, RRR = B, C =RLL etc. Russian emperor sees it as a source of subversion and prohibits all knowledge of telegraphy in Russia.</p>
<p>anyway: competence: idea exists, principles known, there&#39;s a device - the galvanometer - that can be adapted. supervening necessity: railroad. Therefore: multiple devices/inventions/approaches all emerge at roughly the same time. Schilling&#39;s key insight was that the whole approach could be radically simplified by using encoding. faculty of physics at U Gottingen build a schilling-type telegraph to join their department with its lab, 1.25 miles, used a 4-bit left/right code, powered by an early dynamo, not a battery.</p>

<p>starts puttering around himself, especially re telegraphy, but can&#39;t figure out some of the issues related to constant power.

<aside class="notes"><p>Morse and his assistant alfred vail realize, like schilling, that the key to efficiency is code. But unlike others, they didn&#39;t rely on common sense understandings of language but actually went to a printer&#39;s office to look at the trays of type, to figure out the actual frequencies of letter use and thus to develop a code. <strong>It&#39;s easier to learn a code than to design enough circuitry to display letters</strong>  (original plan was to use a codebook, and just transmit numbers, but Vail does the counting of the moveable type and expands things)</p>

When they issued the call, they were thinking optical telegraphy; Morse uses his connections to say to congress, hey, my <em>electrical</em> telegraph will do the trick, give me the money. So they do, in 1843, but they put a time limit on things.</p>
<p>Morse starts building his line along the railroad from baltimore to washington (one of first lines in US); laid his cable in a pipe and buried it. Wire burned out! In a panic, he strings wire from trees, buildings, poles along the route and successfully transmits his message beating the dealine. What has god wrought indeed.</p>
