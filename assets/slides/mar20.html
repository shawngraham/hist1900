<aside class="notes"><p>plot: &quot;High schooler David Lightman (played by 21-year-old Matthew Broderick) is a digitally proficient goofball who wants to play an unreleased computer game — and impress a pretty girl (Ally Sheedy). So he does something most Americans didn&#39;t have a word for back then: He starts hacking. Little does he know, the &quot;computer company&quot; he&#39;s infiltrated is actually a military installation running a missile-command supercomputer called the WOPR (War Operation Plan Response), and the game — Global Thermonuclear War — is real. Naturally, only David can stop it from setting off World War III.&quot;</p>
<p>it was not uncommon for people to randomly dial numbers (using techniques from phreaking, too) looking for data lines into computers. The producers actually talked to a phreak, John Draper aka &#39;Captain Crunch&#39;, who explained about the use of scanners looking for numbers. (Capn Crunch - toy in the cereal box emitted a tone at precisely the same frequency AT&amp;T used to control things). Draper also happened to design a kind of modem device for the Apple II, commissioned by Wozniak, though it never got built; also designed the wordprocessor for the Apple II. </p>

<li>more importantly: Reagan sees the film, makes his cabinet watch it; the fears this prompts find expression in updates and modifications to law. - films were all full of soviet paranoia at the time, and fear of nuclear war., congress prepares a report, and finds the movie is a &#39;realistic representation of access capabilities&#39;</li>

[You can still use BBS](https://www.howtogeek.com/686600/remember-bbses-heres-how-you-can-visit-one-today/)
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>a bulletin board system was a way for a computer to answer a phone call, provide data to the other end, then hang up again. A kind of asynchronous service. Upload/download files, leave messages. Some would let you login, download all your messages/files, read &amp; respond to them, then the next time you logged in, all your responses would be uploaded. Think a combination of reddit &amp; early myspace. And if you don&#39;t know myspace, go look it up. By some accounts, the first BBS was by the Chicago Computer Users Club, when in 1978 a big snowstorm prevented them from meeting. One of the club&#39;s members had a modem, and he set up a basic message board on his own machine in his own apartment, allowing a &#39;virtual&#39; meeting.</p>
<p>Fidonet - Tom Jennings (one of many queer figures in computing history) figures out a way to get BBS out of their isolation and to talk to each other. He writes a program called FIDO for IBM pc&#39;s running MS-DOS, to let people set up their own BBS. But he adds a feature to it to let one BBS call another and swap data. Fidonet is born, a store and forward type network. Initially only email being swapped, but because he made it open, people build it into other BBS services.</p>
<p>wargames introduces the idea of bbs to a wider audience, and numbers explore. Early commercial online services like Prodigy, America Online, and Compuserve were largely bulletin board services with a few additional bells and whistles; others like the Well (1985) whole earth &#39;lectronic link were more diy ish. These early and mid 80s services taught an entire generation how to &#39;be&#39; online, and many of these ways-of-being can be traced back to Community Memory and Reource One. Stacy Horn, ran the extermely influential &#39;The Echo&#39; out of her appartment in New York - made having women part of the governance and organization of the BBS a key part; the Echo is still online - <a href="https://www.echonyc.com/">https://www.echonyc.com/</a></p>
<p>more info: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/social-medias-dialup-ancestor-the-bulletin-board-system">https://spectrum.ieee.org/social-medias-dialup-ancestor-the-bulletin-board-system</a></p>
<p>untangling all of these - including things like BITNET (which was a store-and-forward network that started in 1981, connecting universities in the US and Canada) - would make excellent entries for your final Memex. Especially BITNET - look into its Canadian dimensions</p>

Stacy Horn, The Echo
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p><em>anyone</em> could set up a BBS. And so BBS&#39;s became these amazing carnivals of different people, united by shared interests. Every BBS had its own social norms, expectations. It kinda reminds me of picking a server to join for Fediverse type software (aka mastodon). It was personal, intimate. A place of connection. And because of telephone bills, it required a certain creativity to work around the limitations this imposed. For Horn, she got so much traffic that the new york phone company had to lay a dedicated data line down her street.</p>

<li>france telecom offers free terminals, creating effectively a national bulletin board service, users pay by the minute; but individual services (ie, sites/servers) can connect to this service, france telecom takes a cut of $ for time spent on the services. train schedules, email, news, tax filing, chat... similar services tried in other countries but don&#39;t take off. Minitel lasts until well into the 2000s. (I remember something similar on british tv in the 90s, greatly reduced function though)</li>

<aside class="notes"><p>university illinois urbana-champaign begins in early 1960s thinking about how computers might be used in education. Don Bitzer, phd student in CS talking with Chalmers Sherwin (in aftermatch of sputnik launch and fears US was falling behind educationally) asked, why couldn&#39;t computers be used in education? &#39;a book with feedback&#39;. They design a system, and install terminals, in hundreds of schools over the 1960s and 1970s. The system has graphics, simulations, forums, messages, pretty much everything we know and love about learning management systems today. As microcomputers/personal computers developed, they tried to port it from the mainframe system to work with eg IBM pcs, but it wasn&#39;t really working out; they even create a version for the Source, another early online service for dial-in modem users (bought by Reader&#39;s Digest, as it happens).

And games beget magazines, and BBS looking for people to swap games, hints, tips, talk strategy, etc.</p>

- these early communities give people a sense of how to *be* , via a computer
- because a lot of the early games were about recreating a sense of an actual place, my contention: these actually *were* places, for all intents and purposes.
- they were someplace you *went.* Your body might be here, but your mind & social world were elsewhere.

<aside class="notes"><p>By 1979, only 16 arpanet notes were academic; the 46 remaining were military; 1983 those military ones spun off into MILNET; ARPANET shut down in 1989. So, while the TCP/IP protocols for how networks and computers might communicate originate in ARPANET (remember, the story is more complicated than that), other protocols, other groups, other networks, and other ways of doing data communication have emerged.</p>
<p>Indeed, a number of CS departments in the states NOT on ARPANet managed to convince the NSF in 1981 to pony up cash for a leaner network, the CSNET (computer science research network). It offered different tiers of connectivity - just email, for instance- and soon had more than 70 sites by 1983; used TCP/IP; unlike arpanet, the finances of this arrangement worked better, and the NSF agreed to build a &#39;backbone&#39; connecting up the supercomputing centres that <em>it</em> funded. 1986. This was the NSFNET and it was a super high speed connection The NSF also agreed to allow commercial access to NSFNET in 1</p>

## Exercise - A Knowledge Graph / Social Network

- who is connected to whom?
- scour your memex for individuals and organizations
- eg, you find 'Charles Williams jr', 'Alexander Graham Bell' 
- or 'Vannevar Bush' and 'von Neumann'
- think about the *directionality* of that relationship 
- Record your findings here:
	- [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19KBKE2RFZBzsLmUQ--1dRXj9w8zz1Pu4HjoKnXN2diU/edit?usp=sharing)
- find at least 5 pairs

Then we'll drop our network into [Network Navigator](https://networknavigator.jrladd.com/)

- Who or what has the highest 'betweeness'? What might that mean?
- Who or what has the highest 'eigenvector centrality'? What might that mean?
- Capture a screenshot of the visualization for your notes; write up your thoughts

<aside class="notes"><p>By creating a simple visualization, based on what we can find in our notes, we can start to discover, much like the &#39;paul revere&#39; visualization we saw in an earlier class, some of the possibilities for understanding how social structure &amp; agency can intersect</p>
<p> Going further with <a href="https://gephi.org">Gephi.org</a>
    - another metric we ofent might want: community detection</p>
