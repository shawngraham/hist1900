</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>just like everything else in the 19th century, things in mathematics are hotting up. there is a movement to put all of mathematics onto a rational, systematic basis by developing axioms that could be the building blocks of a &#39;total&#39; mathematics. In 1931 Kurt Godel demonstrates that you can&#39;t build a proof around the consistency of a mathematical system that describes all of mathematics</p>
<p>I don&#39;t pretend to understand the mathematics completely, but the upshot is that there are true mathematical statements that cannot be proved from whatever the system is you&#39;re working in. In which case, how can you know if you&#39;re dealing with a problem that cannot be proved? How do you decide what to do? This is the &#39;decidability&#39; problem- Entscheidunsproblem.  Much fighting ensues.</p>
<p>Turing builds a thought experiment, creating a machine to explore this problem</p>

The turing machine

_I'm not even gonna try to illustrate this one because it always does my head in_

[but this is a pretty straightforward explanation of how it works](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/how-computers-work/0/steps/49259)
</div>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>remember too that when he says &#39;computer&#39; he means, a person who computes; he describes how a human computer breaks down a problem into its component parts, and each observation he makes changes his &#39;state&#39; of mind; he makes a direct correlation between a human computer&#39;s state of mind and a particular configuration of his machine.</li>
<li>his machine can read, write, scan &amp; remember binary numbers on a tape. Calls it a &#39;universal engine&#39; in homage to Charles Babbage (remember, most of Babbages writings/Lovelace&#39;s writings about Babbage, weren&#39;t really in broad circulation. He was remembered, but not in detail)</li>
<li>he uses this machine to test if there are any conditions where it can predict if it will fail, and if there are any conditions where it can predict whether a symbol will be printed.</li>
<li>this thought experiment enables him to figure out how to identify such problems; a side effect of his &#39;machine&#39; is that it can compute any computable sequence</li>
<li>thus a machina ratiocinatrix- tying a machine&#39;s state to a human&#39;s state of mind - meant that a thinking machine was possible.</li>
<li>Turing might&#39;ve been first to publish, but not by much. Alonzo Church, Emil Post, publish similar work within <em>months</em> - per Winston, why is this unsurprising?</li>
<li>note also that Turing&#39;s machine depends on Boolean algebra, which reduces logical statements to on/off states.</li>
<li>a turing machine manipulates <em>symbols</em>. That&#39;s the big thing.</li>
</ul>

Shannon again & telephone relays/exchanges
</div>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Shannon&#39;s work puts the focus not on the content, but the accuracy with which it is transmitted</li>
<li>if information is quantifiable, it can be expressed as a probability/uncertainy</li>
<li>say there&#39;s a horse race, and we have a guy at the end of the course with two different coloured flags to wave to signal which horse won.  a four house race: </li>
<li>Horse 1: red/red; </li>
<li>Horse 2: red/blue</li>
<li>Horse 3: blue/blue</li>
<li>Horse 4: blue/red.  Each wave is on bit: red is a 1 (on), blue is a 0 (off). Thus, four horse race needs 2bits of capacity.</li>
<li>8 horse race you&#39;d need three waves (horse 1: red/red/red, 2 red/red/blue). </li>
<li>8 horse: 3 bits.</li>
<li>16 horse: 4 waves of the flag or 4bit etc.</li>

Combine information theory with Turing's 'universal computer' and you have a way for a machine computer to simulate any of the work a human computer could do.

<li>heavily involved with Manhattan Project (had expertise on mathematics of shaped explosives), early digital computation; professor with Institute for Advanced Study (in Princeton)</li>
</ul>
<p>In a hugely influential report from 1945, he explicitly makes the connection between the use of telephone relay technologies (circuits) which can be in discrete states, with the way that neurons in animal brains work. Explicitly making the connection between switches/bits/information and cognition (even if we still don&#39;t really understand how that works in the brain)</p>

Speaking of metaphors... back to Babbage
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>Turing knew of Babbage&#39;s work; he framed his language of his &#39;universal machine&#39; in terms that paid hommage to Babbage</p>
<ul>
<li>turing&#39;s machine was to use punch cards<ul>
<li>one set: instructions</li>
<li>other set: data to work on</li>
<li>input data &amp; intervening computations get kept in a &#39;store&#39; - Babbage using language of the weaving industry</li>
<li>the actual computing done in the &#39;mill&#39;. Babbage designs it to do branching operations (logic) by jumping between the mill and support; prints out results 
thing about the analytical engine is that it&#39;s not clear that it could change its program depending on its calculations. This, per Winston, is the central difference between a calculator and a symbol-manipulator(computer). Thus babbage is creating a powerful calculator, and puts him in line with Leibniz, Pascal, and Napier.</li>
</ul>
</li>

Mauchly & ENIAC

<img src="eniacport2-1878887183.jpg" alt="" style="object-fit: scale-down">


- Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator/Computer
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>Prof at Urinus College; was interested in meteorology; despairing of all the calculations, took a summer course at Moore School of Electrical Engineering in 1941 to learn about electronic devices. In 1940, had heard a paper by John Atanasoff describing the design of an electronic calculator he was building, that instead of relays, would use vacuum tube valves. In the summer of 1941, Mauchly visits Atanasoff and learns more about it.</p>
<p>After his time at Moore School, Mauchly gets a faculty post there; invites Atanasoff to join. A declines. In 1942, Mauchly writes a memo &#39;The Use of High Speed Vaccum Tube Devices for Calculating&#39;</p>
<ul>
<li>this memo gets lost. But Herman Goldstine naval attache officer working at the moore school - overseeing ballist firing table generation on an analogue differential analyzer - mentions it to the operator as perhaps a better way of doing this.</li>
</ul>
<p>they go looking, can&#39;t find it: it&#39;s 1943 now- Mauchly&#39;s secretary reconstructs the memo from her shorthand dictation notebook! and presents it Oswald Veblen (connection to neumann - Veblen was at Institute for Advanced STudy from 1932 onwards) who oversaw the Ballistics Research Laboratory - &#39;give him the money!&#39; </p>
<p>Goldstine and Mauchly write a detailed proposal &amp; costing by 1943; work began that June. Brings in Presper Eckert (who handled a lot of the valve work) - 17 000 tubes, 100 000 pulses a second, therefore 1.7 billion opportunities to break down every second!!!</p>
<p>took 3 years to build (war rationing). By 1945, it was ready for testing. They do a public unveiling, setting up a ballistics question for it to calculate in front of a live audience - which it did, taking 20 seconds, or shorter than the actual calculated shell would&#39;ve flown! They also made a point of saying that the &#39;girls&#39; could compute this in 3 days, the differential analyzer in 30 minutes, ENIAC in 20 seconds.  The first programmable, electronic, general purpose computer. (although a court case in 1974 would say the Atanasoff was the first)</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>Lovelace can&#39;t publish her thoughts on the engine on her own; but she can translate the work of the italian scholar Menebrae, who heard Babbage talk in Turin (he was there to drum up finances to give it all a go) and wrote his own thoughts. Lovelace translates the work, but then annotates it with so much of her own work that she wrote triple the length of the original article. In it she describes how to set Babbage&#39;s engine in train, in order to calculate such things as Bernoulli numbers; conceptualizes how other kinds of things might get computed - ie, thinking in terms of symbolic logic. HOWEVER, she dies at 36 years of age (uterine cancer) and her work for most part fades away (becomes known again in 20th century). But in order to program the machine, she had to understand its engineering completely. Babbage jus had to figure out how to add, subtract, etc. Lovelace had the harder job.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>Kleiman: They had to track each piece of data, wire it into a panel, such as a multiplier or a ‘square rooter,’ and then move the result — physically by wire — to another panel for storage,” she said.</p>
<p>The women kept track of the steps and diagrams for the wires manually on what they called “pedaling sheets.” As Bartik described it: “ENIAC was a son of a b— to program,” she said in the documentary “<a href="http://eniacprogrammers.org/">The Computers</a>.” Eniac could handle branching logic and loops. These women write the first algorithms that could write their own algorithms! they come up with idea of subroutines and packaging little pieces of code together for reuse, assigning symbolic letters/numbers to these, to speed up programming work. Grace Hopper comes to work with the MCC company; horizontally flat company, women there in lots of positions of authority; MCC isn&#39;t a good business though. Bought by Rand in 1950; now the women have to work in a hierarchy and report to men who don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on. The salesmen can&#39;t figure out how to sell the machines, so the women do that too. AND the women provide the tech support to the clients so that they can get their machines to do whatever they want. Rand only figures they&#39;ll build 6 machines a year; in the first two years, the women sell 42 machines. These women built programming, they built support, they built sales, they built use cases and business cases for the existence of the machines. (Rand gets bought out in 1955 by Sperry, becomes Sperry Rand)</p>
<p>my point - the work that no one valued - the actual operation of things, the doing of the tedious calculations - that gets coded &#39;female&#39; very early on, and while everything depends upon it, no one in power treats it as important. But by tying it to digital computing, it becomes a superpower, and so a pattern repeats itself: women are devalued, pushed out. They end up training their (male) replacements.</p>
