### Expectations for the 2nd Memex Check-in March 10

1. be on time!
2. if you haven't yet managed to make a public memex read the tech FAQ **carefully**
	- if you're choosing a private memex: you don't need the template! but you *do* need markdown links
3. ask for help **before** March 10th, and frame the request **usefully**

- have at least **another** five sources adequately translated into note form
	-  notes with the bibliographic info, general summary
	-   atomic notes as appropriate
	-   interlinkages
	-   links outwards to others' memexes, or hypothesis permalinked annotations
	-   maps of content as appropriate providing a useful 'way in' to your memex as suits your own research interests

<li>&#39;adequately&#39;: the summary notes we more or less let slide, in terms of their form &amp; content; this will not be the case this time. THIS TIME, ADD THE DATE YOU MADE THE SOURCE NOTE.</li>
<li>atomic notes: observations with page numbers, clearly things you&#39;ve spotted in the readings. There should be atomic notes <strong>for each</strong> source note</li>
<li>interlinkages again. We will be looking for links to idea notes in particular this time, as appropriate.</li>
<li>maps of content. Not just lists of links, but different maps are suitable for different purposes.</li>
<li>IF YOU MAKE YOUR REPO PRIVATE, you do not have to use the template or the html export. BUT you <em>could</em> edit your notes to use regular markdown links. PRIVATE REPOS ONLY!!</li>

Gray versus Bell
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>Reiss&#39; device - telegraph people thought they could use it to pump multiple signals through. Elisha Gray builder of telegraph equipment; modifies one to transmit tones on musical scale; sells to Western Union by 1874. In 1876, takes his device to Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition; meets Bell there; next month makes a speaking telelphone. His focus on telegraphy probably why he didn&#39;t do the paperwork carefully enough to see off Bell. The confusion of who-invents-what-when and other legal machinations leads to many court battles. </p>
<p>Bell at the time was using money from the father of a student he was tutoring (and who he wanted to marry). Bell had filed a patent that described a machine that didn&#39;t exist - but which was close to what Gray was already putting out in the world. Bell was working at his lab in Brantford ontario, using liquid as part of the transmitter; spills it, says the famous &#39;watson come here i need you&#39; which watson can hear through the device. They bring it to the philadelphia exhibition too; demonstrate it. Phrases spoken include mary had a little lamb - phrases easily guessed at - wows the crowds.</p>
<p>legal battles. eventually, gray gets bought out.</p>
