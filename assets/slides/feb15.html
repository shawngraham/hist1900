Multiple services emerge; Multiple lawsuits

- Cooke and Wheatstone have american patents prior to Morse
- Alexander Bain, 'Chemical telegraph' (1843, similar in concept to Davy's)
- Competing services, technologies stringing lines side-by-side (as between Boston and Washington, New York and Buffalo)
- Eventually Morse is triumphant in the courts.

<p>-it&#39;s worth quoting Winston in full: &#39;What had initially been adopted to avoid wasting taxpayers&#39; dollars became a self-denying ordinance - the government would not engage in profitable communications enterprises. In time, this would help underpin the received opinion that government enterprises in telecommunications cannot, by their very nature, be profitable. (This then becomes self-fulfilling: if such enterprises are profitable, then they should be, and are, privatised).</p>

## International Telegraphy

- 1852 Frederic Gisborne lays cable between New Brunswick and PEI

how do you transmit across a body of water, let alone an ocean?</p>
<ul>
<li>two schools of thought. Morse, Faraday though wider the wire, the more electricity you&#39;d need, so it should be as thin as possible</li>
<li>William Thomson (who becomes Lord Kelvin) says, no, the resistence to flow is inversely proportional to the square of the cable&#39;s length. ie, you need a big thick wire. obviously more expensive, heavier, too.</li>
<li>Gutta Percha Company manufactured the cable &amp; its insulation, went with Morse/Faraday idea. Weight 107 pounds per mile (other kind was 392 pounds per mile)</li>
<li>250 tons of gutta-percha used</li>

<li>Frederic Gisbourne had been trying to lay cable between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. Meets Cyrus Field, wealthy New Yorker who agrees to bankroll things.</li>
<li>Original idea was to just string from St. John&#39;s to the rest of north america, use fast boats to move the news (shortest crossing of the atlantic). Field thinks bigger - Ireland! (which was already connected to England)</li>
<li>by 1856 St John&#39;s to New York works; Field is working both sides of the atlantic for funding; mix of private &amp; gov&#39;t money secured</li>
<li>took 3 weeks to load the cable; too much for one ship.</li>
<li>1857 - USS Niagra and HMS Agamemnon set out from Valentia, Ireland, w/ 1300 miles of cable. Niagra unrolls first (so in a way is tethered to Ireland); they can also send messages back to the station on land, so can keep in touch AND test that cable is working. Idea is that at midpoint on ocean, they&#39;d splice the cable with that on Agamemnon to continue rest of the way.</li>
<li>by August, cable stops working, then machinery on Niagra snaps the cable. 300 miles lost. Season abandoned.</li>
<li>1858 - plan is to start in the middle; splice the two coils together, sail in opposite directions (while sending messages back and forth to make sure everything works). should be faster. storms and technical difficulties kibosh this attempt.</li>
<li>1858 later that summer - try the same plan again. august 2, Agamemnon reaches Ireland; august 5, Niagara reaches newfoundland. connected up; telegrams sent; americans immediately suspect the congraulation from Queen Victoria to be a hoax.</li>

Investigation ultimately decided that chief engineer Edwin Whitehouse (Atlantic side) was to blame, by having pumped 2000 volts through the line from time to time to try to improve the signal. Investigation in the 20th century of the cable demonstrated serious manufacturing defects, implying the cable would&#39;ve failed no matter what, but in having someone to blame investors could fire him and try again - <em>the tech is fine!</em> just need better people</p>

Ask yourself, whenever you come across a new tech in this story:
- what are the competencies on which it rests?
- what are the social necessities that would support its adoption?
- what are the accelerating and braking forces that move it forward/hold it back?
- what are the social/political/economic/environmental consequences?

Tom Everett [Writing sound with a human ear: reconstructing Bell and Blake’s 1874 ear phonautograph](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5dc1/d9f362fec1208fb9b555c589cd0a9daeb62d.pdf)

Task: 

Use Everett's article as a way of framing keyword or keyword phrase searches for more information about the phonautograph and its relationship to telephony. 

Then, using the framework of 'competences', 'social necessity', 'brakes/accelerators' and what you read in Standage, make some 'idea notes' about why telephony emerges, exists in parallel to, and ultimately overtakes telegraphy
