# Text Formatting 

You can have lists like this

```
- first
- second
- third
```

Or checklist lists to

```
- [ ] ==Get==
- [ ] things
- [ ] ~~done~~
```


Within obsidian, you can drag and drop images right in. Then, start typing:

```
![[ 
```

and the file selector will open. Select the filename for the image you want, hit enter, and ta da!

For notes and images that you want to push online, just make sure that the images are in the main `website` folder (if you're a github newcomer) or the `\docs\` folder if you're using git at the command line and have cloned the repository into your vault. 

THEN, just drag and drop the images and notes via the 'upload files' button on Github, when you are on the `\docs\` subfolder in your repository.

More formatting options for your webpage [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/formatting/#highlighting-changes). (but not compatible with Obsidian)
