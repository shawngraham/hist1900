While it is cool to be able to manage and build a website from within Obsidian ([[Set Up Your Own Website|see these instructions]]), that approach requires a *public* repository that anyone might find.

There can be good reasons to want to not do that. If those apply to you, you don't need to tell me why. Here is a simple alternative setup:

1. make a new repo on github
2. set it to private
3. initialize it with a readme
4. add `shawngraham` as a collaborator
5. use windows explorer or mac finder to locate your notes created using Obsidian. They will have the `.md` file extension. Drag and drop your .md files onto your private repository to upload them. Commit your changes.
