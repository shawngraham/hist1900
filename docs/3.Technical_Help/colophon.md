This website is built from a folder within my Obsidian Vault where I first collected the materials that I wanted to teach in this class.

I used [obsidian-publish-mkdocs](https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs) , a public repository by Github user [jobindjohn](https://github.com/jobindjohn) to do this; it is based on the static site generator [mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
