While it is cool to be able to manage and build a website from within Obsidian ([[2.Set Up Your Online Memex|see these instructions]]), that approach requires a *public* repository that anyone might find.

There can be good reasons to want to not do that. If those apply to you, you don't need to tell me why. Here is a simple alternative setup:

1. make a new repo on github
2. set it to private
3. initialize it with a readme
4. add `shawngraham` as a collaborator
5. in Obsidian, go to settings -> files and links -> and turn off wikilinks (this means you'll have to use standard markdown links, eg `[display text](file)` to link things.)
6. use windows explorer or mac finder to locate your notes created using Obsidian.  They will have the `.md` file extension. You can also right-click on a note name in the Obsidian side bar, and select `reveal in finder` to find the actual text file for your note. Drag and drop your .md files onto your private repository to upload them. Commit your changes.
