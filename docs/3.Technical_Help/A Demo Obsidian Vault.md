Here will be a a link to an obsidian vault preconfigured with a few useful bits and bobs to get the student started. It will be a minimal vault.

You can download this vault - remember, a 'vault' is just a folder with text files that have the `.md` file extension - and open it with Obsidian. 'File extensions' are that part of a file name after the period; sometimes these are hidden by your computer. A file extension is just a signal to your computer about the kind of program to open the file with. Thus `.docx` means, 'open this file with word', and `.ppt` means, 'open this file with powerpoint'. So `'.md'` means, 'open this file with whatever program understands text files that use markdown conventions to gently stylize the text.' A mouthful, yes.  

Put the vault (i.e., 'folder') somewhere on your machine that is sensible. _Don't_ leave it in your 'downloads' folder. Put it on your desktop or 'my documents' folder.

!!! note

	...incidentally, 'folder' just means a place on your machine; folders are nested - they sit inside one another. So on my Windows machine, my 'teaching' folder can be found in this sequence or **path** of nested folders: 
	`C:\smg-machine\Documents\work\2023\teaching\`

## Setting this vault up for use

Fire up Obsidian; select 'open vault' and select the folder you just downloaded. When you open it the first time, Obsidian will ask you if you trust the author (i.e., me). Say yes.

## Contents of the vault

This vault has been organized with subfolders like so:

```
|-_ancillary_code_do_not_touch
|-_note_templates
|-inbox
|-source_notes
|-atomic_notes
|-media
|-guidance
|-website
	|-index
```

Inside `ancillary_code_do_not_touch` are some special templates that use a bit of javascript to handle retrieving annotations from [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) and also from pdfs annotated within[Zotero](https://zotero.org)
