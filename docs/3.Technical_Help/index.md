Help with the technical aspects of this course can be found here.

You might want to start with [[zotero|getting Zotero set up on your machine.]] Also, I have [[A Demo Obsidian Vault|preconfigured an Obsidian vault with some useful plugins to get you started.]]

Then, try [[Set Up Your Own Website|setting up Obsidian and Github so you can build a nice looking website from your notes]]. Alternatively, you might want to keep this material private, so [[Making material available online using a private repository|follow these alternative instructions]].

If you've never written anything using markdown conventions before, worry not; [[Text Formatting|here's a quick primer.]]

You will receive an invited to a Discord server set up for this course. It is a place for you to socialize, to ask for help, to share resources, to collaborate. I like Discord for my student hours because I share audio and video and my desktop with you easily, and you can do the same as well. Our TAs will be present and active in Discord as well. **There is a code of conduct to agree to** in order to use our Discord. It is a privilege, not a right, to have a Discord server; anyone abusing that privilege will be banned.

More help will be posted here as needs emerge.
