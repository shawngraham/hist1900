Help with the technical aspects of this course can be found here.

You might want to start with [[zotero|getting Zotero set up on your machine.]] Also, I have [[A Demo Obsidian Vault|preconfigured an Obsidian vault with some useful plugins to get you started.]]

Then, try [[Set Up Your Own Website|setting up Obsidian and Github so you can build a nice looking website from your notes]]. Alternatively, you might want to keep this material private, so [[Making material available online using a private repository|follow these alternative instructions]].

If you've never written anything using markdown conventions before, worry not; [[Text Formatting|here's a quick primer.]]

More help will be posted here as needs emerge.
