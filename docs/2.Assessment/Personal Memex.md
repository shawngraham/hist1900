In this assignment, which unrolls over the duration of the entire term, you will create your own personal 'memex' of a kind first described by [Vannevar Bush in his article, 'As We May Think.'](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) published in The Atlantic in 1945.

## Build your Memex

This involves:

- making annotations on the readings, via your own [Zotero](https://zotero.org) library
- extracting those annotations to a single note in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
- writing a summary note on the reading
- refactoring the extracted annotations into individual, 'atomic' notes (one idea per note)
- interlinking the atomic notes to each other to the summaries as appropriate (use the graph feature to help with this)
- adding new notes with your own thoughts/observations (including from my lectures)
- interlinking those as well.

Then:

+ you do this on your own machine, but you will choose to make a subset (or all, it's up to you) of these notes available online
+ this can be done either publically or privately: [[Set Up Your Own Website|Pushing your materials online at a public location]] | [[Making material available online using a private repository]]
+ note that you do not have to use your real name if you choose to make things public.
+ I will share with you the URLs of others' memexes and I will encourage you to make external links to ideas your peers have made.

**This mirrors the ways documents and servers and the other bits and pieces of the internet came to become interconnected.**

### My Evaluation

Points that I look for as I evaluate your memex as it develops:

- are notes well documented? have you used the templates to good effect?
- are there sensible interlinkages? 
- is there evidence of careful, reflexive thinking? Is there evidence of taking in the discussions, making connections between what you have done/heard/read? Explicitly cite materials that underpin your thinking using Harvard author-date contextual citations or link to the items directly in your Zotero library
- is there evidence for how feedback has been considered, adopted, adapted? Is there evidence for a developing sophistication in the work?

Assessment will be along the spectrum “unsatisfactory - satisfactory - exceptional”. Numerically, this translates as:

-   unsatisfactory: 0-2 points (ie, F-D range)
-   satisfactory: 3-4 points (ie, C-B range)
-   exceptional: 5 points (ie, A-A+ range)


## The Final Journey

^98ce79

At the end of the course, you will install the 'journey' plugin from the Obsidian Community Plugin catalogue (click on the 'settings' cogwheel, bottom left, community plugins -> browse) to craft a summary note for the course. 'Journey' will find paths through your notes from a starting note to a finishing note. 

- you will identify a starting note and a finishing note that will enable you to answer the question, '**what is the most powerful thing you've learned in this course**'. 
- You copy the results of that path as a list of links. 
- You will make a new note into which you paste that list of links.
- You explain the path to your reader by writing new text woven around these links that explains how the path unfolds. You may wish [[to embed blocks from the individual notes]].
- You will make sure that every note in that path is pushed to the online version of your memex. 
- You push this note to your online memex, and add a link to it from your `index.md` note.

This 'final journey' note will show me a number of things. It will demonstrate how your thinking has evolved in the course; it will demonstrate how you make the explicit connections between the materials we've studied and your thinking on these matters. You will notice that this is not an essay. It is rather more like an evolving personal wikipedia, and this 'final journey' note gives me a path into your thought.

Your memex & final journey note will be assessed on how compelling and effective each is (following [Paul Daniel O’Donnell](https://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay)); O'Donnel frames these elements around his idea of an 'unessay':

> The main criterion is how well it all fits together. That is to say, how compelling and effective your work is.

> An unessay is compelling when it shows some combination of the following:
> 
> -   it is as interesting as its topic and approach allows
> -   it is as complete as its topic and approach allows (it doesn’t leave the audience thinking that important points are being skipped over or ignored)
> -   it is truthful (any questions, evidence, conclusions, or arguments you raise are honestly and accurately presented)

> In terms of presentation, an unessay is effective when it shows some combination of these attributes:
> 
> -   it is readable/watchable/listenable (i.e. the production values are appropriately high and the audience is not distracted by avoidable lapses in presentation)
> -   it is appropriate (i.e. it uses a format and medium that suits its topic and approach)
> -   it is attractive (i.e. it is presented in a way that leads the audience to trust the author and his or her arguments, examples, and conclusions).


The personal memex and the final journey are graded as two separate items.
