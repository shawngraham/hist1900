These readings are meant as starting places, not ending places. Read them, find them, drop them into [scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com) and find out what other people have used them, thought about them, developed them. Read them along the lines I explain in [[How To Read An Academic Article]]. 

I have drawn from many - but not all - of these to help me prepare my talks. No doubt you might know or encounter materials that you feel the rest of us should know about. If that is the case, use Hypothesis, while logged into our reading group, to annotate the appropriate part of the course where you think others might find the materials you've encountered useful. I'm grateful to Ian Milligan, Michael Kramer, and Ryan Cordell for sharing their syllabi with me or making their own syllabi public on the web.
