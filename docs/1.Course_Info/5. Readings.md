These readings are meant as starting places, not ending places. Read them, find them, drop them into [scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com) and find out what other people have used them, thought about them, developed them. Read them along the lines I explain in [[How To Read An Academic Article]] and annotate along the lines I describe in [[How to Mark Up an Academic Article]]. I'm grateful to Ian Milligan, Michael Kramer, and Ryan Cordell for sharing their syllabi with me or making their own syllabi public on the web. 

I have drawn from many - but not all - of these to help me prepare my talks. Similarly, there are things I am drawing on that are *not* on this list. No doubt you might know or encounter materials that you feel the rest of us should know about, too, from your other coursework. If that is the case, use Hypothesis, while logged into our reading group, to annotate the appropriate part of the course where you think others might find the materials you've encountered useful, and share links or bibliography. 

Some of these you will be able to annotate in your browser using [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is); others you might find easiest to save-as pdf and then drag into zotero, where you can annotated with Zotero's pdf reader (some publishers make things as difficult as possible to read, which begs the question...)

I have selected materials that *should* be accessible to everyone, online. And yes, my citation style is all over the place. If only I'd saved everything to Zotero first, *then* built this list!
