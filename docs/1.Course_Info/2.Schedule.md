<img src="../../assets/original-sketch.png" align="left" width="30%"></img> The image at left is the original sketch for this course. I was trying to plot out the elements and ideas that I thought were important for you to know, how they might interrelate, and the kinds of supporting exercises we might do that will help you make sense of this material. The schedule below, derived from that sketch, is provisional. Topics might get shifted around.

The [[4.Readings|readings]] that support a particular week are indicated by surname below; you can find the full bibliographic info and links on the [[4.Readings|readings]] page.  Try to have them read before the session indicated. You may need to go through the [library website](https://library.carleton.ca) to obtain things. 

The elements below are subject to change as the course evolves; a class can develop over time.
