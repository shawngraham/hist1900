<img src="../../assets/original-sketch.png" align="left" width="30%"></img> The image at left is the original sketch for this course. I was trying to plot out the elements and ideas that I thought were important for you to know, how they might interrelate, and the kinds of supporting exercises we might do that will help you make sense of this material. The schedule below, derived from that sketch, is provisional. Topics might get shifted around.

The [[4.Readings|readings]] that support a particular week are indicated by surname below; you can find the full bibliographic info and links on the [[4.Readings|readings]] page.  Try to have them read before the session indicated. You may need to go through the [library website](https://library.carleton.ca) to obtain things. 

The elements below are subject to change as the course evolves; a class can develop over time.

These classroom sessions will involve exercises to help you get Obsidian, Github, Zotero, Hypothesis etc set up, and to give you an opportunity to learn how to get *note making* working using these tools. I will also be discussing the connections between what you'll encounter in the book lab with the themes and content of this course, and getting you set up towards your first *assessed* piece of work for the course. 

**If you weren't able to secure a slot** we are looking at our Master Printer's schedule to find out when we can book more time with him so that everyone gets a chance, at some point this semester, to explore these early technologies.
