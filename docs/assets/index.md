Hi! This folder contains the imagery assets for the whole vault/website. If you're looking for the slidedecks for the lectures, you can find them by appending the relavant date in short form ('jan9', 'jan11' etc) to this url:

`https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/slides/{date}`,

Thus, the first meeting's slides are at:

[https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/slides/jan9](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/slides/jan9)

Otherwise, there's nothing to see here ;).
