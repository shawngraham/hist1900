<aside class="notes"><p>Imagine.... it was cool out... you descend into these caves. by the guttering lamp light, the images dance and flicker and seem to come alive. What might these images mean? What do the dots convey? What is <em>the message?</em></p>
<p>per the guardian: &#39;Cave paintings of species such as reindeer, fish and now extinct cattle called aurochs and bison have been found across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>. Alongside these images, sequences of dots and other marks have been found in more than 600 ice age images on cave walls and portable objects across Europe....By using the birth cycles of equivalent animals today as a reference point, the team deduced that the number of marks associated with ice age animals were a record, by lunar month, of when they were mating. They believe the inclusion of a “Y” sign, formed by adding a diverging line to another, meant “giving birth”.</p>
<p>a protowriting system (cuneiform emerges 3400 bc in sumer). writing on stone, writing with pastes mixed up from bodily fluids, ground up mineral pastes, charcoal from the fire: these messages were meant to last, meant to be understood; and they said, &#39;we are here and this is ours&#39;.</p>

The Medium is the Message
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>sometimes the fact of the medium is often more important than the message itself. the way we extend our minds into new technologies has an impact on how we use old technologies; he called this &#39;amputation&#39;- we extend our minds, our abilities with cars, we tie off or allow to wither the way we used to build cities with walking in mind. consequently, our health suffers, and we end up with cities where we couldn&#39;t really walk even if we wanted to. Such is barrhaven. He also argues that when we over extend, when the negative effects of the new technology become too much, we lose the benefits of the new technology.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>Classification and the catalogue as a control of knowledge dissemination (Foucault). he argues that when classifications shift, there&#39;s been a shift in power or focus too. he also points out that classification puts some things out-of-bound, all the better to control them.  He explores how these classifications get made manifest in architecture, for instance, and how they create new objects for study.</p>

<p>a society can be illiterate even if it also has a writing system</p>
<p>The evolution of writing systems seems to emerge out of the need to count - whether what is counted is heads of sheep, baskets of grain, lunar cycles and the pregnancy of animals, or the motion of stars in the sky (calendars).</p>

<p>Writing systems seem to be associated at first with places of ritual and communal gathering.

<li>takes his starting point from Francis Bacon, who argued all knowledge comes from memory, reson, or imagination, thus books could be classified as either being history, philosophy or &#39;belles lettres&#39;, stories</li>
<li>he worked in the amherst college library, and wanted the library to be used for educating folks beyond the library. he studied other libraries - finding that there was no real systemization of the catalogue (dogs under &#39;dogs&#39;, &#39;horses&#39; under &#39;horses&#39;, neither under &#39;animals&#39;, eg), or alphabettically according to author</li>
<li>encounters the idea of using decimals as classifiers, since a decimal number is infinite</li>
<li>he orders knowledge philosophy (contains everything else) theology, government, philology, natuer (math, phs, chem, etc) useful and fine arts, finally geography, biography, history.</li>
<li>but all this was filtered through his experiences and what he was taught at Amherst</li>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>dewey&#39;s system hits the US at a period when publice benefactors are building, expanding and reorganizing public libraries;</li>
<li>the other major system is the library of congress cataloguing system, designed at roughly the same time. The LLC is different from dewey in that it focuses on what is actually in the collection, rather tha proscribing how knowledge should be organized. Dewey turns up often in public libraries, LLC in research ones; universities are expanding at this time too. LLC reflects the biases of Congress&#39; interests (&amp; the fact that the library was started with the gift of Jefferson&#39;s personal library &amp; his interests) - american, european, christian bias.</li>
<li>These are the two systems that would&#39;ve seemed a natural way to organize knowledge to the same people who start working on what it means to compute &#39;information&#39;</li>

Plot so far *continued*

- no natural way for documents/information to be organized;
- people *tried* to find a 'natural' way to organize information
	- these categorizations ended up reifying the way they already believed the world to work
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" -->
<div class="" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; height: 700px; width: 960px; min-height: 700px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center" absolute="true">

- in a north american context, the two big approaches hit at the same time there is massive public investment and expansion and reform of education (even the blackboard was a new idea once!)
- proximity on shelves also enables a kind of *discoverability*; 'serendipity' it's sometimes called: but a function of a particular vision of the world, a reproduction of its norms
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" -->

- invention of the digital computer happens not all that long after these massive reorganizations
- the digitization of knowledge is built by people for whom these categorizations/classifications of the world are normalized

<aside class="notes"><p>But the creation of a new class of document - the electronic document - on a new medium - the computer - inspires new ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>&shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->People like Vannevar Bush are already thinking about what a digital computer might do to <em>knowledge work</em> (which isn&#39;t what computers were invented for!)</li>
<li>Peple like Ted Nelson is inspired by the Memex to invent the term hypertext to capture the idea that maybe documents might have a kind of &#39;awareness&#39; of each other</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" -->
<div class="" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; height: 700px; width: 960px; min-height: 700px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center" absolute="true">

So, to sum it all up:

- the physicality of messages/books has impacts in the world
- this physicality has changed over time/ thus impacts in the world have changed
- when new classifications shift, there's a shift in power too
	- every phase of the 'internet' that we shall see involves this shift
</div></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"><!-- .slide: class="drop" -->
<div class="" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; height: 700px; width: 960px; min-height: 700px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center" absolute="true">

Oh, and:

- with digitization, messages/content had potential to be 'aware' of their relationships to other messages/content - key insight of the memex
- 'hypertext' becomes an attempt at realizing that potential, but bi-directionality not implemented
- recent trends, software like notion, roam, obsidian, enables that bi-directionality.
