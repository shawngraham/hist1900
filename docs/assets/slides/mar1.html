> In a similar manner, it is conceivable that cables of telephone wires could be laid underground, or suspended overhaed, communicating by branch wires with private dweelings, country houses, shops, manufactories... uniting them through the main cable with a central office where the wires could be connected as desired, establishing direct communication between any two places... I believe, in the future, wires will unite the head offices of the Telephone Company in different cities, and a man ...may communicate by word of mouth with another in a distant place.

<aside class="notes"><p>Briefly: the vacuum tube
-a lightbulb is a glass bulb, through which a tungsten filament is passed. Electric current passes through the tungsten, heats it up, and it emits light. To keep it from burning out, you need to have a vacuum in the bulb or a noble gas that doesn&#39;t react.
-a vacuum tube is the same thing, but without the filament. Turns out, electrons can be emitted by the cathode across the gap, the vacuum can transmit electricity. On the other side you have a grid of anodes. Depending on how things are arranged, you can use this to amplify a signal. Thus you can use it in circuits as a valve, forcing the current to travel in one direction. </p>

<li>everywhere else, phone systems seemed to be coming under control of government; some US Postmaster General Albert Berelson makes a gambit for control too</li>
<li>Bell, AT&amp;T, Theodore Vail - navigate all this by agreeing that monoplies should be regulated, but &#39;government ownership would be unregulated monopoly&#39;. </li>
<li>AT&amp;T in 1913 agree to make long distance lines available to the smaller local companies to use, and agree to ask permission before acquiring any other companies.</li>

<li>post world war i, nationalisation abandoned. 1921 Graham Act makes the arrangement of 1913 a permanent feature of US telecommunications</li>

Redundancy is the key to understanding language.

(it's also why modern large languge models like GPT3 work, but that's a story for another day)

<aside class="notes"><p>I am <em>not</em> suggesting in any way shape or form that the music of Smash Mouth is meaningful like the Dùndún Talking Drum.</p>
<p>most european languages do not rely on tonal differences; thus for a long time european colonizers could not recognize what they were hearing as language, as information-rich. John F. Carrington one of the first europeans to learn how to drum; published his understanding of how they worked in 1949 in &#39;The Talking Drums of Africa.&#39;</p>
<p>The <em>redundancy</em> of both examples is the key element that ties this all to information theory.</p>
<p>At the same time Carrington was publishing this work, and describing how the drums permitted a redundancy that made clear their meanings, researchers invovled with Bell Telephone were trying to quantify how to deal with the noisiness of their telephone lines. Basically, they found that the fewer symbols or <em>ways of representing the message</em> available for a message, the more of them must be transmitted to get the message across. (Ralph Hartley, H= n log s, H is amount of information ,n the number of symbols in the message, and s the number of symbols in the language) For telephone engineers, &#39;symbols&#39; could be the phonemes of language or the ways an electrical circuit could be completed or interrupted.</p>

Claude Shannon in 1948 took this idea to its logical conclusion and developed a way to think about a message as being composed of two things:

- the content
- the information

'Information' is a measurment of the redundancy of that content, or how 'surprising' the next letter/sound/wave/ is.

<aside class="notes"><p>Shannon Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty associated with a random variable. It is used to measure the average amount of information that is needed to identify the value of a random variable. The higher the entropy, the greater the amount of uncertainty or unpredictability. In other words, Shannon Entropy measures the amount of information that is needed to accurately predict the value of a random variable, ie, the next letter in a sentence.</p>
<p>The concept of a bit was introduced at the same time by Shannon and is fundamental to understanding entropy. A bit is a unit of information that has two possible states: 0 or 1. These two states represent the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system. </p>
<p>For example, if a system has two possible outcomes, such as heads or tails in a coin toss, then the system has one bit of information. The more possible outcomes, the more bits of information, and thus the higher the entropy. Entropy is a fundamental concept in information theory and is used to measure the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system.</p>

Combine information theory - the division of a message from its meaning - with logical circuits and you get the 20th century.

<aside class="notes"><p>This is a key insite that emerged at the same time as so many key insights that together enable the digitization of the world. </p>
<p>But this digitization happens in the context of a lot of other things, among them, Alan Turing&#39;s ideas on what can computable (and how), work on representing neural networks as electrical circuits, the rendering of Boolean logic into circuits as well, and a number of other items we&#39;ll look at in due course.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t need to know, as historians, precisely how the maths of this work. Suffice to say, thinking of a message as a function of probability enables a lot of digital technologies.</p>
<p>And it enabled Bell Labs to make long distance telephony clearer, more reliable, and more profitable.</p>
