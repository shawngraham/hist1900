### First Assessment

I will put together a demo memex with what I'm after, where the quality of work is sufficient for a 'satisfactory'.
<small>

- at least:
	- five **sources** adequately translated into note form
	-   notes with the bibliographic info, general summary
	-   atomic notes as appropriate <- important observations from your sources
	-   interlinkages 
	-   a map of content note providing some initial structure, an initial 'way in' to your memex
</small>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>you could have a note on bush, on caulfield, on walkowitze, on dooley</li>
<li>you can make notes on other kinds of resources too, including documentaries, although there you&#39;d have to keep track of time stamps, and your notes would have to involve double checking or verifying statements made in the documentary, or trying to find materials that support/contest those statements</li>

Evidence that silk was being made in India by the 3rd millenium BC. That&#39;s a big swathe of the world, and the work and effort required to make silks made them luxury items from the get-go. Silks from India, China highly desireable commodities in the rest of Eurasia; calling the main trade route &#39;the silk road&#39; (a linking up of a variety of local trade networks into one larger network from China to Europe) gives a sense of how important this is; not just trade, but religion, disease, whathaveyou moves along this route</p>

Some Weaving terms
- warp - the vertical threads, held in tension
- weft - the horizontal threads
- shed - the space created when some warp threads are lifted up
- shuttle - a wooden block used to pull the weft threads through the shed
- comb - pushes the threads tight together once the shuttle has passed through
- drawloom - enables individual warp threads to be drawn up

Implications of a drawloom?

- 2 person set up
- slow - care, feeding, value?
- how much land devoted to flax, to mulberries, to sheep, etc?
- reproducibility? 
- training?
- think in terms of assemblages, things coming together

*...this is the kind of thing you could sketch out in Obsidian canvas, btw...*

<aside class="notes"><p>a big issue is that every fabric is a one-off; the loom is not a machine, not really, in the sense of it does something over and over again, but rather a prosthesis to enhance manual abilities - like an abacus helps with counting and remembering, but doesn&#39;t do the counting itself</p>

What *did* Jacquard invent?

- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->An approach that applied threaded together punch cards to the automatic control of the loom.
	- 24 x speed increase! (ie 2 feet per day)
	- replicable patterns, complex patterns, multiple machines producing identical swathes of silk

<li>we say that J invented the programmable loom, but it was more a confluence of events, an assemblage. <em>someone else might eventually have done it too, at roughly the same period</em>. The pieces after all were already around (I wonder if our desire to ascribe a &#39;first&#39; to everything is a descendent of the &#39;doctrine of discovery&#39;) - social/political/technological life is a complex system, of interconnected parts with feedback loops and dynamic change and emergent phenomena. At the same time, it does require a person to <strong>make something</strong> of the connections/positioning in the system...</li>

Let's look at something made on a Jacquard Loom

<li>napoleon into silks, would only wear silk from Lyon</li>
<li>declares J loom public property, gives J income &amp; royalities for life equivalent in buying power to millions of dollards</li>
<li>french tried to keep j looms from spreading outside france, but the british soon had them too (eventually hooking &#39;em up to steam, but that&#39;s a story for another day)</li>
<li>Jacquard becomes &#39;jacquard&#39;, a term of art to imply weaving done a particular way; computerized jacquard machines exist, airbags are made with them because the weaving has to be so tight</li>
<li>traditional jacquard looms still in use in Lyons, Queen Elizabeth&#39;s train for her wedding was made on one; suppppper expensive and prestigious</li>
<li>story that draw boys of Lyons threw jacquard into the river, mad at being put out of work</li>

Difference Engine / Analytical Engine

- 'difference' because it uses the method of differences to calculate tables by adding the differences between items in a series. But had to be set up manually: no cards

adam smith pin factory
Gaspard de Prony who devises a way of breaking apart all the steps in computation of logs so that teams of fairly unskilled workers can do it (tables of logarithms help people with engineering, life insurance, surveying, lots of things: but has to be <strong>correct</strong>)
babbage conceives of the idea of using cogwheels to perform simple math, in series of steps; the cards would allow pins to drop to engage some cogwheels and not others
conceives of idea of using punch cards as way of putting information into his machine and out of his machine, to do such calculations automatically</p>

"**_We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves…_**" - Ada Lovelace  

- depends upon cards to enter data, output data, store instructions

We'll talk more about Babbage - and more importantly, Ada Lovelace - later.

<aside class="notes"><p>While B could imagine the device and how it would do basic operations, Lovelace figured out how to <em>program</em> it to do just about anything; this too is a pattern we&#39;ll see again and again - people design and build things with no idea how to make the things actually <em>achieve</em> results, and frequently the people who figure out the programming were women.</p>
<p>btw google just released a LLM for music, finally realizing Ada Lovelace&#39;s prediction</p>

**...a bit of fun:**

[Make your own punch card](http://knitting.bikibird.com/jacquardform.html)

For added challenge, use Baon's Bi-literal cipher from last week. 

Can you encode your name into the punch card?
