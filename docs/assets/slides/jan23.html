Mary Wenwood, ex-wife of a revolutionary called Godfrey Wenwood, wanted to send a letter from her new lover, Dr. Benjamin Church Jr, to a british officer in Boston. Godfrey Wenwood didn&#39;t deliver it; sat on it instead, not wanting to be associated with the british officers. She asked him to courier <em>another</em> letter some time later. This time, Wenwood took it to Washington, and they opened it. Seeing it in code, they arrested Mary. They were able to crack the code and the contents were damning, revealing Church to be a spy embedded amonst important revolutionaries. Washington had some officers familiar with cyphers, and they broke into two teams to try to crack the code.</p>

_London, 1772._

<div align="left">
<small>

I have been asked by my superiors to give a brief demonstration of the surprising effectiveness of even the simplest techniques of the new-fangled _Social Networke Analysis_ in the pursuit of those who would seek to undermine the liberty enjoyed by His Majesty’s subjects. This is in connection with the discussion of the role of “metadata” in [certain recent events](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-prism-server-collection-facebook-google) and the assurances of [various respectable parties](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/why-metadata-matters) that the government was merely “sifting through this so-called metadata” and that the “information acquired does not include the content of any communications”. I will show how we can use this “metadata” to find key persons involved in terrorist groups operating within the Colonies at the present time. I shall also endeavour to show how these methods work in what might be called a _relational_ manner.

_On Extracting Obscured Correspondence_

<div align="left">
<small>

> One way to solve an encrypted message, if we know its language, is to find a different plaintext of the same language long enough to fill one sheet or so, and then we count the occurrences of each letter. We call the most frequently occurring letter the "first", the next most occurring letter the "second", the following most occurring letter the "third", and so on, until we account for all the different letters in the plaintext sample. Then we look at the cipher text we want to solve and we also classify its symbols. We find the most occurring symbol and change it to the form of the "first" letter of the plaintext sample, the next most common symbol is changed to the form of the "second" letter, and the following most common symbol is changed to the form of the "third" letter, and so on, until we account for all symbols of the cryptogram we want to solve.
