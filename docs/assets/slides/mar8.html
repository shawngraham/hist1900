## ENIGMA

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/EnigmaMachineLabeled.jpg" alt="" style="object-fit: scale-down">
</div>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>based perhaps on the ideas used in a commerical machine developed by Edward Hebern aimed at banks and business and anyone who didn&#39;t want their messages being read on the telegraph; although like everything else, others were working on similar cyphering devices based on rotors</li>
<li>German:  Arthur Scherbius - calls his &#39;enigma&#39;, meaning, &#39;riddle&#39;</li>
<li>typewriter key, wired to lights showing letters. substitution cypher - A becomes Q. But if you can change the wiring with each keystroke, becomes a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. Easy to break, with one rotor. But with two rotors, 26 × 26 = 676 letters, but you only need to know two letters/numbers to set up/decrypt. 3 rotors: 17,576</li>
<li>add a bit more enigneering: <code>Combining three rotors from a set of five, each of the 3 rotor setting with 26 positions, and the plug board with ten pairs of letters connected, the military Enigma has 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 (nearly 159 quintillion) different settings. (5 × 4 × 3) × (263) × [26! / (6! × 10! × 210)] = 158,962,555,217,826,360,000.</code></li>
<li>Scherbius dies in a cart accident in 1928. By mid 1930s, every branch of german military using the machines</li>
<li>a quirk of the machine was that no letter could be encyphered as itself; this eventually is the crack into which the wedge is driven to break the codes</li>
<li>polish gov&#39;t sees what&#39;s coming down the pipe - they&#39;d broken the 3-rotor machine by mid 30s; mere weeks before the invastion, Poles shared what they knew/techniques with the French and Germans. Throughout the war, the game becomes adding complexity to the machines, and then trying to break those machines.</li>
<li>the poles created a machine called &#39;the Bombas&#39; that basically reverse-engineered Enigma. But everytime more rotors get added to enigma, the previous &#39;bombas&#39; is no longer useful</li>

<li>Government Code &amp; Cyper School - Bletchly Park</li>
<li>Turing and his crew worked in hut 8 on the problem of cracking the naval Enigma machines</li>
<li>they knew the principles, and had good idea of its design.</li>
<li>Turing et all worked to improve the Bombe machines - specialized calculators - to break the codes</li>
<li>dozen mathemtaicians, 4 linguists, 100+ others all women apparently</li>
<li>drawing on a tradition of specialized electro-mechanical devices for mathematical research in Britain; simpler machine in many respects than what Zuse or Aitken or Mauchly were doing. But then again, the need was much greater.</li>
<li>they focussed on &#39;probable words&#39; that were used as the keys to set the rotors up in the first place; plaintext was used in some messages, and keeping track of what plaintext was used and in what contexts eventually gives them a method for starting to test possible keys. Sometimes they&#39;d spot messages sent in less secure ways being retransmitted on more secure machines, so breaking it on the lesser machine would give a key to the stronger. </li>
<li>the bombe would churn through the possibilities; by 1941 they could crack a message in a day</li>
<li>by 1942 germans added another rotor; Allies didn&#39;t know, until a radio operator sent a message with one wheel turned off, then corrected himself and sent the same message again with a wheel turned on thus revealing existence of a new wheel.</li>

<li>German encryption required more powerful devices</li>
<li>British build a device that can do boolean operations, but is more similar to the analogue computers of vannevar bush; but also involves valves and relays and paper-tape readers. </li>
<li>a rickety device: didn&#39;t have to be pretty, just had to work.</li>
<li>to improve things, they work out how to store the patterns to search for encoded in valves, and so only the messages they&#39;re intercepting have to be put on the machine. </li>
<li>by 1943 allies are able to neutralise german encryption again; many estimate this shaves two to three years off the war</li>
<li>anyway, this makes ENIAC &amp; COLOSSUS sit astride the phase transition from powerful calculators to full-on computers</li>
<li>the difference is that a full on computer must have a datastore in which its operating instructions are held, and which can be varied because of the calculations being done.,</li>

## Post War Developments Doldrums

- multiple teams are exploring these machines that sit on the calculator/computer barrier
- von Neumann writes the 'First Draft of a Report on The EDVAC' 1945
- but for the most part, the urgency is gone; everyone losing steam, in terms of computing design
- last technical hurdle to solve is the problem of memory (many solutions mooted, workable)
</div>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>von Neumann&#39;s paper circulates widely; it describes the kinds of things a computer - a proper computer - ought to have, given what they now knew about such devices. One author puts it like this: &quot;It was as if, in the early 1890s, somebody had specified, in some detail, the fundamental design elements of an automobile - and that this document acted prescriptively to limit the range of options available to engineers in the decades following&quot;</li>
<li>Influenced Turing, Mauchely, the folks at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Princeton, anyone who was into these devices read this report.</li>

## From One Supervening Necessity to Another

- Project Whirlwind
	- starts off as a kind of analogue computer meant to simulate flight on multiple kinds of airplanes being developed during the war
- most expensive of the various computing projects; navy loses interest
- airforce takes over: the only machine that could plot intercept courses for strategic long range bombers 
- solves the problem of magnetic memory
</div>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li><p>didn&#39;t work all that well at first</p>
<ul>
<li>ENIAC happens; Whirlwind rejigged for digital real-time output and parallel processing</li>

<li>construction starts in &#39;49, by &#39;49 it works</li>

## Allies no longer sharing information

- act of congress in 1946 closes off data sharing with allies over nuclear work
- Britain sets out to build its own expertise
- Decides that all such experiments ought to be centralised at the National Physical Laboratory
- The 'official' British Computer will be built at NPL, and they turn to Turing to make it, the 'Automatic Computing Engine'

<li>work as at Manchester also shows how successful Britain&#39;s boffins were at controlling things though. Manchester only got funding for their machine by saying it&#39;d be used for &#39;pure&#39; phsyics/maths research - same gambit that von Neumann used for getting computing work happening at the Institute for Advanced Studies in the US</li>

## The Death of Alan Turing

- Turing moves to Manchester to work on computing 1948
- His house is burgled; he calls the police. In the course of their investigation, Turing is forced to admit he is homosexual. 1952
- He was found guilty of gross indecency; imprisonment or probation with chemical castration
- loses security clearances. Chooses castration.
- commits suicide 1954
- pardoned in 2012

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>cold war paranoia about the &#39;right&#39; sort of person also felled Mauchley. Remember ENIAC and Eckert &amp; Mauchly&#39;s computer company, its take-over by Rand?.  The month the first UNIVAC computer shipped, in 1952 - Mauchley stripped of his security clearance for supposed communist ties: he had signed a petition for civilian control of nuclear power</li>
<li>this same paranoia would also destroy britain&#39;s domestic computing industry, as they tried to weed out women and other &#39;unreliable&#39; types in favour of public-school educated old boys. Harold Wilson mandates a nationalization of computing industry in 1965, just a godawful mess. See Mar Hicks, Programmed Inequality</li>

## The Period of the Digital Incunabula is Over

- In the UK, commerical versions of the Manchester 'Baby' are being sold by the Ferranti corporation as general purpose business computers by 1951

## Programming still an issue

- every computer has its own wiring, circuits, designs, idiosyncracies
- people like Grace Hopper are building compilers and higher level languages to ease programming and provide some interoperability
- mostly male programmers liked the secrecy of the way things were
</div>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>&#39;the way things were&#39; meant that they relied on the mystery of it all to maintain the positions, priviledges. </li>
<li>a lot of these tasks were highly sensitive operations, but since they relied on no one knowing what they were doing, they did a lot of work virtually in the open; security always gets bolted on afterwards</li>
<li>people using the Whirlwind computers developed a kind of language to work with it</li>
<li>Grace Hopper also the impetus behind the languages FORTRAN and BACAIC</li>
<li>IBM builds FORTRAN into its machines starting from about 1958</li>

## Upshot
- every machine is unique
- every machine is ever larger, more expensive
- living on the gov't dime: both the funder, and buyer for these devices, largely.
- Eventually, something's gotta give: is it an effective use of money to build machines like this that could often stand (comparatively) idle?

## Is it time for the internet yet? 

Competences
- existence of digital computers

The idea of timesharing, of interleaving different instructions/code to occur during idle times (that is, idle from the perspective of a computer) emerges in the 1950s; to the user, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any interruption at all</li>
<li>Whirlwind, the machine for intercepting bombers, develops to the point where IBM sells a version of it to American Airlines in 1964 - central computer, terminals in airports, managing reservation system</li>
