Remember, info theory allows us to separate meaning of a message from its 'information', the measure of its redundancy, hence, the amount of damage it can take and still be understood.

Without that insight, nothing else can work. It's what makes digital communications *work*.

It can only be in one place... The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain."

<p>AT&amp;T &#39;hardened&#39; exchanges, and connected things up in a grid, in contrast to hierarchical civilian lines. Distributed nodes, but those nodes centrally controlled, telephone switches.

[3420 Boetler Hall](https://uclaconnectionlab.org/internet-museum/)

- First four IMPs, $360 000 each
- Programming to make them work: $640 000
- IBM says, *imps, shmimps*. IPTO buys from Honeywell instead (a DDP-516).
- *in rugged design suitable for battle-field use!*

Who will build these IMPs?

- coming from Honeywell, yes, but extensive customization needed
- Boston company: Bolt, Beranek and Newman gets the contract
	- Licklider *just happened* to have worked for them in the 1950s.
- How do you make this thing, a 'router'? How do you actually make 'packet switching' work?

The thing that gets designed ultimately is a fusion of Baran and Davis' designs and concerns

- fewer of the 'hardened' cold-war survivability features
- more of the high-speed transmission, adaptive routing

<p>US invested in more &#39;pure&#39; research, while UK sought immediate economic benefits</p>

Not just the Internet. The same structure gives us.... the [Mother of All Demos](https://invention.si.edu/mother-all-demos)

<li>Englebart strongly influenced by &#39;as we may think.&#39; Showed off windows, hypertext, graphics, navigation, command input, video conferencing, computer mouse, word processing, file linking, revision control, collaborative-realtime editor</li>
</ul>
<p>-hugely influential for subsequent developments</p>
<ul>
<li>Roberts sees ARPANET as way to bring researchers together, &#39;cooperative computing&#39; for the common good</li>
<li>everyone working for him sees this as a chance to advance pure research in a brand new field</li>
<li>telephone people just think the whole project is doomed to failure (see also: Defense Communications Agency)</li>
<li>computer science people think the task of reordering &amp; reassembling packets will prove to be too computationally intensive to be worthwhile, or that other packets would get lost forever  (these problems did emerge, but did not prove to be insurmountable)</li>

Anyway...

- By focusing on IMPs and how to automatically read the network for congestion and figure out the best route, BBN & IPTO & ARPA sidestep the local mainframe people
- local mainframe people only have to figure out how to make the first link to IMP; not every centre with a mainframe was on board with this project.

- by 1968-9 things are happening fast
	- BBN working on the honeywells, routing algoritms, protocols for IMPs
	- main frame teams form themselves into a 'Network Marking Group' to figure out their end
		- Standford Research Institute comes up with the LOGIN command
	- ideas like skipping IMPs and going computer-to-computer, treating each other as a terminal of the other... lots of ideas are kicked around
	- different groups form around the different problems

We'll take a look at the 'Network Information Centre' at SRI
