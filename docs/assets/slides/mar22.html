- 1986 NSF backbone is built; NSF, like DCA before it, limits use to 'approved' uses. Also decides to use TC/ICP

First 'viruses' and 'worms' written mostly as experiments

Creeper - designed by Bob Thomas at BBN; it would copy itself onto connected computers. the first worm. 1971. 'I'M THE CREEPER CATCH ME IF YOU CAN'

Reaper - designed by Ray Tomlison, to seek out and eliminate Creeper. 1972

<aside class="notes"><p>virus: requires a host program to move around; it executes itself before the host program does what it is supposed to do. worm: self sufficient program on its own. Creeper wasn&#39;t malicious - it was mostly a &#39;I wonder if this will work&#39;. It would copy itself to a new machine, and delete itself on the old machine if it could.
Alan Davis, grad student at UIUC, devises a process for a PDP-11 computer: it would see if a copy of itself was running; if not, it would make a copy and start it; then it would see if disk space was available; if so, it&#39;d make a file that would fill that space, then start the process over again. If someone tried to save work, there&#39;d be no space; if they deleted something, the space would automatically fill up again. Yeah, this one is malicious. A similar virus called &#39;Rabbit&#39; spreads the following year. I do not know who is behind that one.</p>
<ul>
<li>some of these things spread because <em>people</em> share the host software - they ftp it to a new system, or later, it&#39;s on a floppy disc.</li>
<li>some of these things spread because they actively are looking for a connection</li>

- the 1980s sees a growing awareness of 'connected' computing
- turning up in culture (eg WarGames; Terminator)
- commercialization of the government created infrastructure
- internetworking of private networks into that infrastructure
- common carriage of traffic (what is later called net neutrality) a feature
- Al Gore secures funding for another round of development, meant to expand access and foster more research

A *pattern language*, per [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/xanadu-patterns) helps us approach questions like:

-   How do we structure information and build relationships between pieces of data that help us see them across contexts, and clarify understanding?
-   How do we build systems that allow people to collaborate on shared documents without losing authorship? How do we credit and compensate authors based on their contributions?
-   How do we bring ideas and data from a variety of sources into conversation with our own, while leaving a clear trail back to the origin?

<li>The Domesday Discs had crowdsourced memories and stories, pictures and video - tremendous multimedia</li>
<li>at Southampton, CS dept not interested in her work on multimedia; moves to U Michigan discovers this is called &#39;hypermedia</li>
<li>eventually returns to Southampton in time for the donation of Mountbatten&#39;s papers (war hero, assinated in 1979 by IRA)</li>
<li>archive had film, photo, sound, no linear sequence of material, archivists were despairing how to archive it</li>
<li>by 1989 they had a hypermedia system running that interwove the materials in the archive - multimedia navigation, database of links that new what was connected, using the metadata about the links to foster new kinds of information. the link wasn&#39;t in the document, it was in the linkbase and it overlaid all of the materials. Where the archives mention Ghandi, the linkbase contains the idea of Ghandi, thus one link actually ties to multiple materials. Evans: &#39;for every name, for every idea, for every linkable thing,  a single repository of supplementary material updated by everyone in the world, filtered based on parameters determined by the user&#39;</li>
<li>a link could point to multiple places at once, and new links could be generated on the fly. The value was on the associations, not the documents</li>

<aside class="notes"><p>Marshall comes up with a system that imagines information on notecards with hypertextual linking, where cards could be chained together into sequences, or mind maps, or collections; part writing tool, part information browser. Marshall called it an &#39;idea browser&#39;. They actually designed it for use in Intelligence analysis (so that the premises on which policy was built could be examined.) Intelligence services never use it. Used throughout PARC though</p>
<p>I was part of a project in about 1995 using hypercard to try to publish an archaeological excavation. I didn&#39;t understand what I was tasked to do.</p>
<p>Notecards begets &#39;Aquanet&#39; (after haircare product, holds knowledge in place), Viki (uses a spatial metaphor). These tools were more about information management; they were actual environments - places - that helped structure thinking, &#39;systems that model - and more important, change-our minds&#39;.</p>

"HyperText is a way to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will. It provides a single user-interface to large classes of information (reports, notes, data-bases, computer documentation and on-line help). We propose a simple scheme incorporating servers already available at CERN... A program which provides access to the hypertext world we call a browser... " Tim Berners-Lee , R. Cailliau. 12 November 1990, CERN

<aside class="notes"><p>Tim Berners Lee - his vision of hypertext features one-way links only; and he figured the document would be the atomic unit of thought, hence urls point to <em>pages</em> </p>
<p>since the links are not bidirectional, link rot and decay is inevitable</p>
<p>Hypertext attendees not impressed. Berners Lee mostly ignored. REquirement of internet connection was still very costly, and the &#39;hypertext&#39; as implemented was not even as sophisticated as Engelbart&#39;s original demo.</p>
<p>By hypertext &#39;93 more than half the demos were web based; by hypertext &#39;94 Berners Lee gives the keynote address.</p>

Clare Evans:

"Today, we mostly think of hypertext as being something related to the Web, rather than of the Web as a technically inferior manifestation of hypertext principles"

</div>
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>But just like the early arpanet only became popular through a very minimal use of its capabilities - email - so too does hypertext only become popular through this minimal realization. But it pretty much nukes hypermedia as a research area. By 1994, a lot of the pioneering work done by people like Cathy Marshall is forgotten, ignored, reinvented. Amazing. By 1997, a separate Web Conference has emerged and scheduled at the same time as the hypertext conference.</p>
