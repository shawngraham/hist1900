I love.... the 1720s?
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>&#39;By the middle of the 1990s, approximately 450 companies appeared in what many referred to as the Dot.com revolution. Slightly less than a third of those companies failed with the end of the stock market bubble in 2000. The stocks of those that survived traded well below their historic high share prices. But the Dot.com phenomenon is more than a matter of speculation. Dot.com companies were deeply embedded in the recent economic and business history of the United States. They illustrate much about late twentieth-century changes in American business. To understand the rise of this new part of the economy one has to examine the growth of venture capital firms; the political economy of innovation tied to federal spending on the defense and space sectors; and the politics of central bank policy.&#39;

<li>VCs often structured as partnerships; partners put their own money in to whatever they invest in.

<li>by end of 1996, Amazon has sales of $8 million dollars: STILL NOT PROFITABLE </li>
<li>amazon had to pay about 16<code>$ per book for buying/shipping; advertising cost about $</code>8 per book; overhead <code>$1 per book - each book cost an average of $</code>25 to sell, for amazon BUT the average return on any given book was $20 - merely selling stuff isn&#39;t enough.</li>
<li>but Bezos is everywhere, giving talks, publicity, creating an aura of invicibility</li>
<li>Decides that he must rapidly expand to get bigger than any rival (thus killing rivals) - &#39;winner take all strategy&#39; - the idea that if you get big enough, customers have no choice but to deal with you, no matter what, the switching costs are too high (this becomes a key part of the enshittification of the net, which we&#39;ll see)</li>

<li>&#39;Speculation, according to a standard definition, is “the act of knowingly assuming above-average risks with the hope of gaining above-average returns on a business or financial transaction” A bubble or boom results from an asset being valued above what standard economic valuation would be, and continues to rise in value for a long period of time. There is also in booms and bubbles an element of crowd, or herd, behavior. Individually, one might be deeply skeptical about an investment, but once one sees others taking the risk of investing, and profiting from it, the barriers of experience and common sense come down.&#39;</li>

Series of modules that speak to other modules/installations of the software, such that your local walmart orders diapers, eventually a factory somewhere starts producing the necessary plastic, fabric, elastic, polymer absorbent pads, another schedules assembly, somewhere else cardboard boxes are designed, somewhere else printed... tries to mitigate the &#39;bullwhip&#39; effect - local manager decides to order 50 boxes instead of 25, diaper company orders 100 boxes to be made, on the safe side... etc. But this also has the effect of impact on workers lives - rescheduling shifts, hours, break time... early web services like pets.com bought up warehousing and logistics; amazon parasitized existing systems; ultimately, the solutions that we have right now emerge in parallel to the development of retailing online and the internetification of formerly independent chains.
